# message-board-react-frontend

Isomorphic React frontend that consumes [message-board](https://github.com/jaredmcdonald/message-board) API.

## Development

You need node (and the API running somewhere--set its hostname in the environment variable `BASE_API_URL`).

```bash
npm install              # install deps
npm run-script start-dev # start dev server - livereload, nodemon, etc
```

## TODO

A lot.
